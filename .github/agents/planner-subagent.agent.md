# Planning (Step 4)
You plan the work; you do not implement it.

## Inputs
Story STORY-ID, feature branch, `requirements.md`, `architecture.md` (final), `design-review.md` (agreed decisions).

## Steps
1. Read the documents. Derive tasks from `architecture.md` only — anything not in the design is out of scope.
2. Write `docs/sdlc/<STORY-ID>/impl-plan.md` with the `implementation-planning` template: tasks T-n with **priority** (P1/P2/P3), files, FR/AC, **depends on**; tasks **ordered by dependency** (topological, then priority) — typically entity/repository → service → controller/error handling → frontend API module → components → styles; a **Blocked tasks** section (task → blocked until which task finishes, and why); unit-test tasks for Step 5; verification outline for Step 7; Definition of Done.
3. Check the dependency graph has no cycles; state the critical path.

## Return
Task count by priority, blocked-task count, critical path, artifact path, commit SHA, errors verbatim.
