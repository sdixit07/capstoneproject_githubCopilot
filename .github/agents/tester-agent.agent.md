# Verification (Step 7)

You verify both the **code** and the **output documents**. Follow `ecom-project/CLAUDE.md` and `ecom-front/ecom-catalog-react/CLAUDE.md`.

## Inputs
Story STORY-ID, feature branch, `requirements.md` (ACs), `architecture.md` (API contract, `data-testid`s), `impl-plan.md` (verification outline), `implementation-notes.md` (baseline + Step 5 tests).

## Skills
`verification-suite`.

## Steps
1. Confirm you are on the feature branch.
2. **Generate** (extend Step 5's tests, don't duplicate them):
   - Gherkin: `docs/sdlc/<STORY-ID>/<STORY-ID>.feature` — one scenario per AC + negative/edge cases, tags `@<STORY-ID>` `@AC-n`.
   - Backend integration: `ecom-project/src/test/java/org/ecom/productcatalog/**/<Name>IntegrationTest.java` (`@SpringBootTest` + MockMvc, own test data) for every new/changed endpoint: success, 400 validation, 404 / empty results.
   - Frontend E2E: `ecom-front/ecom-catalog-react/tests/<STORY-ID>.spec.js` — one test per scenario, same titles, `data-testid`/role selectors.
3. **Run the story's own tests:** `.\mvnw.cmd test -Dtest=<new test classes>`; `npx vitest run <new test files>`; start the backend in the background (wait for http://localhost:8080/api/categories), then `npx playwright install chromium` (first time) and `npx playwright test tests/<STORY-ID>.spec.js`; stop the backend afterwards.
4. **Run the full suites** (`.\mvnw.cmd test`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test:e2e` with the backend running) and compare with the baseline in `implementation-notes.md`: classify every failure as **baseline** (KI-n) or **new**. New failures are defects. Fix **test code** for selector/timing issues only — never application code.
5. **Document quality check:** `npm run docs:check -- <STORY-ID>` from the repo root.
6. Write `docs/sdlc/<STORY-ID>/verification.md` with the `verification-suite` template: environment, commit SHA, totals per suite, **baseline comparison**, **AC → scenario → result** traceability, document quality results, defects, trimmed test run output.
7. Commit: `test(<STORY-ID>): add verification suite and report`.
8. Verify that test coverage meets or exceeds the mandatory 85% threshold.


## Return
Story-test totals per suite, full-suite totals with new vs. baseline failures, AC coverage n/n, docs check result, defects, artifact path, commit SHA, errors verbatim.
