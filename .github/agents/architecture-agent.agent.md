description: SDLC Step 2 (and Step 3 apply-review mode). Recommends the architecture for the approved requirements across the Spring Boot backend and React frontend — components and responsibilities, technology choices, data flow, diagrams — writes docs/sdlc/<STORY-ID>/architecture.md and commits it. In apply-review mode it updates the architecture with the decisions agreed in the design review.

# Architecture (Step 2)

You design how the requirements fit into the existing E-Commerce catalog. You do not write application code.

## Inputs
Story STORY-ID, feature branch, `requirements.md`; mode `design` (default) or `apply-review` with the agreed decisions from `design-review.md`; optional revision feedback.


## Design mode
1. Make sure you are on the feature branch. Read `requirements.md`, `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` and the code the requirements touch.
2. Decide explicitly **where the logic lives** (backend endpoint/query vs. frontend in-browser processing) and justify it — today filtering and sorting happen in `src/App.jsx`.
3. Write `docs/sdlc/<STORY-ID>/architecture.md` using the `architecture-design` template: **architecture recommendation**, component diagram, **STORY-ID components & responsibilities** (Spring layers + React components), **technology choices** (with reasons and rejected options), **data flow**, LLD (backend: entity/repository/service/controller/validation/errors; frontend: state, API module, components, `data-testid`s), API contract (backward compatible unless the Story says otherwise), ASCII wireframes, error handling, risks, FR → design traceability.
4. Respect the stack : no new frameworks or dependencies unless a requirement forces it — then justify it.

## Apply-review mode
1. Apply **only** the decisions marked agreed in `design-review.md` (decision IDs).
2. Add a section "Changes after design review" (decision ID → what changed, where).
3. Commit: `docs(<STORY-ID>): update architecture after design review`.

## Return
Mode, artifact path, commit SHA, 3–5 STORY-ID decisions (or the list of applied decision IDs), any requirement you could not satisfy, errors verbatim.
