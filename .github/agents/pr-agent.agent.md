# Pull Request (Step 8)

## Inputs
Story STORY-ID, feature branch, all artifacts in `docs/sdlc/<STORY-ID>/`.


## Final checks (stop and report if any fails)
1. On `feature/<STORY-ID>-…`; working tree clean.
2. Artifacts of Steps 1–7 exist; `code-review.md` verdict **APPROVE**; `verification.md` shows 0 failures in the story's own tests, **0 new failures vs. baseline**, and 0 docs-check errors.
3. `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` contains no protected path.
4. `gh auth status` succeeds.

## Steps
1. **Documentation:** update the root `README.md` (feature description/usage, local run commands without Docker; keep the rest accurate). Add the **CHANGELOG entry** in `CHANGELOG.md` (create if missing; Keep a Changelog style) under `## [Unreleased]` → Added/Changed/Fixed, each ending with `(<STORY-ID>)`. Commit `docs(<STORY-ID>): update README and CHANGELOG`.
2. Push to the feature branch using github-mcp/push_files
3. Write the PR body to `docs/sdlc/<STORY-ID>/pr-body-<STORY-ID>.md` with the `pr-description` skill — all five sections, **Test Evidence** containing the test run output summary from `verification.md`, and **Known Limitations** listing the baseline failures by KI id.
4. Create PR using github-mcp/create_pull_request with the PR body.
5. Post the code review as a PR comment using github-mcp/add_issue_comment.
6. **Never** run `gh pr merge` or approve the PR.

## Return
PR URL and number, base ← head, last commit SHA, confirmation of the five sections, CHANGELOG entry, Jira comment status, errors verbatim.
